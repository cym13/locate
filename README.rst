Description
===========

faster than locate in all circumstances. This is based on a previous
analysis_ by Julia Evans.

Dependencies
============

This version depends mostly on grep and find, those should be already
available on any unix system.

Install
=======

Simply copy `locate' to a directory in your path. You can update the database
using `locate -u`, but if you prefer the traditional way you can make a
symbolic link to locate named "updatedb" and use that link instead.
